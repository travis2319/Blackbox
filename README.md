Title: Automotive Diagnostic and Activity Monitoring (ADAM) System

Motivation: 
 Our motivation behind choosing this project was to develop a sophisticated system for vehicle data analysis, enhancing both safety and user convenience while providing forensic advantages.
 
Objective Scope of the Project:
Objective: This project aims to collect data from the vehicle before accidents and create a system for seamless vehicle monitoring to aid in forensic analysis and user convenience.

Scope:
 The application will gather data from the vehicle, preprocess it for analysis, and then conduct the analysis to provide useful insights and outputs.
 
Project Description:
The project "Automotive Diagnostic and Activity Monitoring (ADAM) System" focuses on leveraging advanced technologies to enhance vehicle safety, user convenience, and forensic capabilities. By collecting data from vehicles prior to accidents, the system aims to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks, thereby improving overall safety on the road.
Additionally, the project aims to facilitate forensic investigations by making it easier to monitor vehicle activities and help determine motives in case of incidents. This can significantly aid law enforcement and insurance companies in their investigations.
The system also helps users diagnose problems in their vehicles, reducing the risk of being scammed by mechanics. By providing accurate diagnostic information, users can make informed decisions about necessary repairs and maintenance.
Through a combination of data collection, analysis, and system integration, this project seeks to revolutionize the way vehicles operate and interact with their surroundings. By automating processes and enhancing security measures, the project aims to create a safer and more user-friendly experience for vehicle owners and passengers alike.
This project aims to enhance vehicle safety and convenience by:

●	Collecting and analysing vehicle data to identify potential accident risks.

●	Implementing data mining and cryptography techniques to secure data and prevent unauthorized access.

●	Facilitating forensic investigations by monitoring vehicle activities and helping determine motives in incidents.

●	Helping users diagnose vehicle problems accurately to avoid being scammed by mechanics.
The project involves two phases:
Data Storing, Tracking, & Black Box: Collects and stores vehicle data, creating a black box for accident analysis.

Diagnostics and Monitoring: Provides accurate diagnostics to users for identifying vehicle issues and monitoring activities.
